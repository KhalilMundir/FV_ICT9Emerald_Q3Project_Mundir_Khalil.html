              Gordon Ramsay was born in Scotland and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, where he hoped to be a professional player. When an injury ended his ambitions for a flourishing career on the pitch, Ramsay returned to college to complete a hotel management course. His persistence and natural aptitude led him to train alongside some of the world's best chefs.<br><br>Ramsay is now worldwide known, with seven Michelin stars, and has opened 34 restaurants in Europe, America, Asia, and the Middle East. Ramsay has also become a television sensation in the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving an Emmy nomination in 2017. Ramsay has published numerous books, many of which have been international blockbusters; his most recent cookbook is Gordon Ramsay's Quick and Delicious.</td>
